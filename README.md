PERSONAL_PORTFOLIO

This git repository is used for Calvin Min's Personal Portfolio. The following website shows what I have accomplished throughout my high school career
and beyond in computer science. The home page is mainly used for updates about myself, but the project tab shows major computer science projects
that I either completed or are in progress.
